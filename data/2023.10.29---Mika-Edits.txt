Personal Statement
Law first appeared in my life not as a passion, but as a daunting force. My early encounters were during my parents' prolonged, 13-year divorce, and an adolescence marred by an abusive father and a complex foster care system. Initially, law was a means of understanding and navigating the turmoil around me. Gradually, it transformed into an intellectual beacon, guiding me toward a deeper comprehension and respect for its power.
Despite a challenging home environment and health issues, I forged my path with determination. After securing my GED, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, founding a 3D printing business. This venture not only offered financial independence but also enabled me to pursue higher education, culminating in a bachelorâ€™s degree in 2020 and an MBA in 2021.
My internship at a law firm in Flagstaff between 2019 and 2021 was a pivotal experience. It provided a realistic glimpse into the practice of criminal law, but also exposed its disheartening aspects, such as the leniency in serious cases and the normalized disrespect towards legal professionals. These observations steered me away from criminal law, shifting my focus to corporate law.
At Centuri Group, Inc., my role as a Corporate Legal Assistant involved challenging and creative problem-solving. A significant accomplishment was resolving an issue with the New Jersey Department of Revenue, saving one of our entities from wrongful dissolution. This experience, alongside leading the launch of a new engineering design firm, required extensive legal research into state regulations and honed my interest in business law. These roles not only tested but also expanded my legal understanding and solidified my career aspirations.
I am drawn to business law for its complexity and impact.
